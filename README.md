# Electricity-Demand-and-Price-Forcasting
This repository develops a model for predicting electricity demand and price using machine learning algorithms like LSTM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression. It combines energy and weather data, with preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to ensure accurate forecasts.
